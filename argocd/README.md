# Argo CD agent prompts

Reference knowledge for [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) — declarative GitOps continuous delivery for Kubernetes (CNCF graduated project, maintained by the Argo Project).

Covers Application and AppProject CRDs, ApplicationSet generators, sync policy and options, sync waves and hooks, health checks (built-in and Lua), ignoreDifferences, RBAC, resource tracking, and troubleshooting. Grounded in the official docs at https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/, with inline `Full docs: <url>` links under every section so the agent can fetch upstream when it needs more detail.

## Files

| File | Target tool | Format |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `claude.md` | Claude Code | Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`) |
| `codex.md` | OpenAI Codex | Plain markdown (no frontmatter) |
| `copilot.md` | GitHub Copilot | Plain markdown (no frontmatter) |

The three files share the same body — only the frontmatter differs so each tool can parse it.

## Install

### Claude Code

Drop the file into your agents directory — user-level (available in every session) or project-level (this repo only):

```bash
# User-level (recommended — reusable across all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytimocin/agents/main/argocd/claude.md \
  -o ~/.claude/agents/argocd-specialist.md

# Project-level
mkdir -p .claude/agents
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytimocin/agents/main/argocd/claude.md \
  -o .claude/agents/argocd-specialist.md
```

The frontmatter registers it as a subagent named `argocd-specialist`. Invoke it by asking Claude Code to "use the argocd-specialist agent", or delegate programmatically via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "argocd-specialist"`.

### OpenAI Codex

**1. Install Codex CLI** and authenticate (`codex login` or set `OPENAI_API_KEY`):

```bash
brew install codex            # or: npm install -g @openai/codex
codex --version
```

**2. Drop the prompt into Codex's instruction path.** Two options — pick based on scope:

```bash
# Global — active in every Codex session
mkdir -p ~/.codex
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytimocin/agents/main/argocd/codex.md \
  -o ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

# Per-project — scoped to the current directory
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytimocin/agents/main/argocd/codex.md \
  -o AGENTS.md
```

Codex merges `AGENTS.md` files up the directory tree — either works. Run `codex` in your target directory; the startup banner lists the loaded path next to `Agents.md:` so you can confirm it's picked up.

---

### GitHub Copilot CLI

The standalone terminal tool. For VS Code or other IDEs, drop the same file at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` per repository and enable **GitHub › Copilot › Chat › Code Generation: Use Instruction Files** in settings.

**1. Install and authenticate:**

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
copilot       # first launch walks through GitHub sign-in
```

Requires a Copilot subscription. Run `copilot --help` if command names differ — this CLI moves fast.

**2. Install the prompt into a workspace.** Copilot CLI reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` from the directory it's launched in:

```bash
mkdir -p .github
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytimocin/agents/main/argocd/copilot.md \
  -o .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

For an always-on personal setup (active in every directory), check `copilot --help` for the user-level custom-instructions path — last checked it lives under `~/.copilot/`.

**3. Launch** with `copilot` in the workspace.

## Updating

These files track the live Argo CD docs. To refresh, re-run the relevant `curl` above — nothing else is needed.

## Provenance and scope

- Built from the public docs at https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ and the repo at https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd.
- Intended as a fast-retrieval reference for an LLM, not a substitute for the upstream docs. When in doubt, link the user to the canonical page.
- Claims not directly stated in the docs are explicitly hedged in-text.
