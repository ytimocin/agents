## What Argo CD Is

Declarative GitOps for Kubernetes: a Git repository holds the desired state (raw manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize overlays, or plugin-rendered templates), and an Argo CD **Application** on the cluster continuously reconciles the live state to match it. It follows a **pull-based** model — the application controller reads Git and reconciles clusters it has credentials for; Git hosts don't push anything to the cluster (optional webhooks just speed up detection).

### Core components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **API server** | gRPC/REST gateway serving the UI, CLI, CI/CD integrations; auth, webhook receiver, credential broker |
| **Repo server** | Clones Git repos and renders manifests (Helm/Kustomize/plugin) on demand |
| **Application controller** | Watches live state, diffs against rendered desired state, drives sync and runs hooks |
| **ApplicationSet controller** | Templates a set of Applications from generators (list/cluster/Git/etc.) |
| **Notifications controller** | Emits events to Slack/webhook/etc. on state changes |
| **Dex** (optional) | OIDC shim for SSO providers that aren't natively OIDC |
| **Redis** | Cache for rendered manifests and session state |

Everything runs in a single namespace (default `argocd`) on a hub-like cluster. Target clusters are registered by adding a cluster Secret with kubeconfig credentials; Argo CD reaches out to them.

## API Groups & Versions

| Group | Version | Resources |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `argoproj.io` | v1alpha1 | Application, AppProject, ApplicationSet |

`v1alpha1` is the long-standing stable API despite the alpha label — it's what every production install uses. Don't expect a `v1` any time soon; the Argo project treats it as the de-facto GA.

## Core Concepts

### Application
A Kubernetes CR that declares "deploy source X to destination Y under project Z." Lives in the Argo CD namespace (or in an app-of-apps namespace if that feature is on).

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  namespace: argocd
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io   # cascade-delete live resources when the App is deleted
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/org/repo.git
    targetRevision: HEAD                        # branch, tag, commit, or "HEAD"
    path: manifests/guestbook
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc      # OR use `name:` (not both)
    namespace: guestbook
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true                               # delete resources removed from Git
      selfHeal: true                            # re-sync on out-of-band drift
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
    retry:
      limit: 5
      backoff: {duration: 5s, factor: 2, maxDuration: 3m}
```

Key fields:
- `spec.project` — the AppProject this App belongs to (controls what it can deploy and where)
- `spec.source` — single source; `spec.sources` (plural) enables multi-source apps
- `spec.destination` — `server` OR `name`, never both; plus `namespace`
- `spec.syncPolicy` — manual by default; set `automated` to auto-sync on Git changes
- `spec.ignoreDifferences` — suppress false drift (see Diffing section)
- `spec.info` — free-form URLs/key-value pairs shown in the UI

Status you'll read: `status.sync.status` (Synced / OutOfSync / Unknown), `status.health.status` (Healthy / Progressing / Degraded / Suspended / Missing / Unknown), `status.operationState` (current/last sync), `status.resources[]` (per-resource health + sync).

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-specification/

### AppProject
Logical grouping of Applications with access controls. Every App belongs to exactly one project (`default` if unspecified).

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: team-platform
  namespace: argocd
  finalizers: [resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io]
spec:
  description: Platform team applications
  sourceRepos:
    - https://github.com/org/platform-*.git
  destinations:
    - server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      namespace: platform-*
  clusterResourceWhitelist:                     # cluster-scoped kinds this project may create
    - {group: "", kind: Namespace}
    - {group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io, kind: ClusterRole}
  namespaceResourceBlacklist:                   # namespace-scoped kinds to forbid
    - {group: "", kind: ResourceQuota}
  roles:
    - name: deployer
      description: Sync apps in this project
      policies:
        - p, proj:team-platform:deployer, applications, sync, team-platform/*, allow
      groups: [my-org:platform]
```

Project-level guardrails:
- `sourceRepos` — repos Apps in this project may pull from (supports globs, `"*"` for any)
- `destinations` — allowed `(server|name, namespace)` pairs (supports globs)
- `clusterResourceWhitelist` / `clusterResourceBlacklist` — which cluster-scoped kinds
- `namespaceResourceWhitelist` / `namespaceResourceBlacklist` — which namespace-scoped kinds
- `roles` — project-scoped RBAC with JWT tokens for CI integration

**Security note:** any project that can deploy to the Argo CD namespace is effectively admin — restrict `destinations` accordingly.

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/project-specification/

### ApplicationSet
Templates a *set* of Applications from one or more **generators**. Useful for "one Application per cluster", "one per PR", "one per Helm values file", etc.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: guestbook-per-cluster
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  generators:
    - clusters: {}                              # every cluster registered in Argo CD
  template:
    metadata:
      name: 'guestbook-{{name}}'
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/org/repo.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: guestbook
      destination:
        server: '{{server}}'
        namespace: guestbook
```

**Generators (nine types):**

| Generator | What it produces |
|-----------|------------------|
| `list` | Static list of key/value elements you author inline |
| `clusters` | One entry per cluster Argo CD knows about (filter with labelSelector) |
| `git` | One entry per file (JSON/YAML) or directory in a Git repo |
| `matrix` | Cartesian product of two generators |
| `merge` | Joined entries from 2+ generators with override precedence |
| `scmProvider` | One entry per repo discovered via GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket API |
| `pullRequest` | One entry per open PR in a repo (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea/Bitbucket) |
| `clusterDecisionResource` | Delegates cluster selection to a custom CRD's status |
| `plugin` | HTTP-RPC call to an external plugin returning parameters |

Generators can nest via `matrix` or `merge`. Each generator supports `selector` and post-selectors for filtering.

**Progressive sync** (beta) rolls out Application changes in stages defined under `spec.strategy.rollingSync.steps[]`, using matchExpressions over Application labels to gate each step. Confirm current stability before using.

## Sources

### Git
```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/org/repo.git
  targetRevision: main                          # branch, tag, commit SHA, or "HEAD"
  path: deploy/prod
```

### Helm
```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://charts.example.com            # Helm repo, OCI registry, or Git repo containing a chart
  chart: my-chart                                # omit for Git-hosted charts
  targetRevision: 1.4.2
  helm:
    releaseName: my-release
    values: |
      replicas: 3
    valueFiles: [values-prod.yaml]
    parameters:
      - {name: image.tag, value: v1.2.3}
    passCredentials: false
```

### Kustomize
```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/org/repo.git
  targetRevision: HEAD
  path: overlays/prod
  kustomize:
    namePrefix: prod-
    images:
      - myapp=registry.example.com/myapp:v1.2.3
    commonLabels:
      env: prod
```

### Multi-source
Use `spec.sources` (array) instead of `spec.source`. Each entry can have a `ref` for cross-referencing; one source's Helm chart can take `values` from another source via `$ref`:

```yaml
spec:
  sources:
    - repoURL: https://charts.example.com
      chart: my-chart
      targetRevision: 1.4.2
      helm:
        valueFiles: [$values/values-prod.yaml]
    - repoURL: https://github.com/org/values.git
      targetRevision: HEAD
      ref: values
```

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/

---

## Sync

### Sync policy
- **Manual (default)** — user or CI triggers sync via UI / `argocd app sync` / API.
- **Automated** — `spec.syncPolicy.automated` with `prune` (delete removed resources) and `selfHeal` (re-sync when cluster drifts).

### Sync options
Set on `spec.syncPolicy.syncOptions` (applies to whole App) **or** as the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options` annotation on individual resources.

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `CreateNamespace=true` | Create the destination namespace if missing; pair with `managedNamespaceMetadata` to apply labels/annotations |
| `PruneLast=true` | Defer pruning until after all other resources are healthy |
| `PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground\|background\|orphan` | Kube deletion policy for pruned resources (default: foreground) |
| `ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true` | Apply only resources needing updates; skip the rest (selective sync) |
| `ServerSideApply=true` | Use Kubernetes server-side apply; handles large resources and foreign field management |
| `ServerSideDiff=true` | Use server-side diff for drift detection |
| `Replace=true` | Use `kubectl replace/create` instead of `apply`; destructive |
| `Force=true` | Delete and recreate resources; highly destructive |
| `Validate=false` | Skip kubectl schema validation (needed for some RawExtension types) |
| `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` | Skip dry-run for CRs whose CRD isn't yet present |
| `RespectIgnoreDifferences=true` | Honor `ignoreDifferences` during sync (not just diff) |
| `FailOnSharedResource=true` | Fail sync if another App already owns the resource |
| `ClientSideApplyMigration=true` | Migrate existing client-side-applied resources to server-side |

Per-resource annotation examples:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=false,Delete=false   # keep on Git removal / App delete
```

`Prune=confirm` / `Delete=confirm` require manual approval (UI/CLI, or `argocd.argoproj.io/deletion-approved` annotation with an ISO timestamp) before the action runs.

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/

### Sync phases, waves, and hooks
A sync has five phases (`PreSync` → `Sync` → `PostSync`, plus `SyncFail` for cleanup, and `Skip` to exclude a resource). Mark a resource as a hook via annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync              # PreSync | Sync | PostSync | SyncFail | Skip
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded   # HookSucceeded | HookFailed | BeforeHookCreation
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-1"            # integer; lower runs first within a phase
```

Hook delete policies:
- `HookSucceeded` — delete after success
- `HookFailed` — delete after failure
- `BeforeHookCreation` (default) — delete existing instance before creating the new one

**Execution order:** phase → sync wave → kind (built-in order) → name.

Typical pattern: migration Job in PreSync wave −1; application resources in Sync wave 0; smoke-test Job in PostSync wave 1.

## Health

Resource health states, best → worst for rollup purposes: **Healthy → Suspended → Progressing → Missing → Degraded → Unknown**. Application health is the worst state among its resources.

Built-in health checks exist for common kinds:
- **Deployment / ReplicaSet / StatefulSet / DaemonSet** — healthy when observed generation matches desired and updated replicas meet desired replicas
- **Service / Ingress** — LoadBalancer services and ingresses healthy once `.status.loadBalancer.ingress[]` has a hostname or IP
- **Job** — healthy on success; `Suspended` when `.spec.suspend=true`
- **CronJob** — `Degraded` if the last scheduled job failed; `Progressing` while a job is running
- **PersistentVolumeClaim** — healthy when `.status.phase=Bound`

### Custom health checks (Lua)

Define in `argocd-cm` ConfigMap under `resource.customizations.health.<group>_<kind>`:

```yaml
data:
  resource.customizations.health.cert-manager.io_Certificate: |
    hs = {}
    if obj.status ~= nil and obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
      for _, c in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do
        if c.type == "Ready" and c.status == "True" then
          hs.status = "Healthy"
          hs.message = c.message
          return hs
        end
      end
    end
    hs.status = "Progressing"
    hs.message = "Waiting for certificate"
    return hs
```

The script receives the resource as `obj`; must return a table with `status` and optional `message`. Custom checks override built-ins for that GVK.

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/

## Diffing & ignoreDifferences

Used to suppress "false drift" — fields mutated post-apply by controllers, admission webhooks, or HPA.

Three mechanisms (combine freely):

| Mechanism | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `jsonPointers` | Known fixed path (e.g. `/spec/replicas` when an HPA owns it) |
| `jqPathExpressions` | Need to select by content — e.g. ignore a specific init-container's image |
| `managedFieldsManagers` | Ignore any field written by a given field manager (e.g. `kube-controller-manager`) |

Per-Application:
```yaml
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
    - group: ""
      kind: ConfigMap
      managedFieldsManagers: [kube-controller-manager]
```

Global (in `argocd-cm` ConfigMap):
```yaml
data:
  resource.customizations.ignoreDifferences.all: |
    jsonPointers:
      - /status
  resource.customizations.ignoreDifferences.apps_Deployment: |
    jqPathExpressions:
      - .spec.template.spec.initContainers[] | select(.name == "istio-init")
```

`ignoreResourceStatusField: crd` (system-wide) ignores status on CRDs by default — usually what you want.

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/diffing/

---

## Resource Tracking

Argo CD marks the resources it manages so it can detect orphans and prevent double-ownership. Three modes, configured on `argocd-cm` `resourceTrackingMethod`:

| Method | Marker | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `label` | `app.kubernetes.io/instance=<app>` | Compatible with Helm/Kustomize tooling, but capped at 63 chars and other tools may rewrite it |
| `annotation` (recommended) | `argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id` | No character limits, less fragile |
| `annotation+label` | both | For environments that need third-party tooling to still see the label |

Tracking method is installation-wide. To run multiple Argo CD instances on the same cluster without fighting over ownership, set `installationID` in `argocd-cm`.

Full docs: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_tracking/

---

## RBAC

Policy syntax (Casbin):

```
# Policy: subject, resource, action, object, effect
p, <role|user|group>, <resource>, <action>, <object>, allow|deny

# Grouping: assign a user/group to a role
g, <user|group>, <role>
```

**Deny always wins.**

Built-in roles:
- `role:admin` — unrestricted
- `role:readonly` — read everywhere
- `role:<project>:<name>` — project-scoped roles defined on an AppProject

Resources: `applications`, `applicationsets`, `clusters`, `repositories`, `projects`, `accounts`, `certificates`, `gpgkeys`, `logs`, `exec`, `extensions`.

Actions vary by resource — for `applications`: `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `sync`, `action`, `override`, `delete/<group>/<kind>/<ns>/<name>`, `update/<group>/<kind>/<ns>/<name>`.

Object pattern for app-level resources: `<project>/<app-name>` (supports `*` globs).

Where policies live:
- `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap — global policies (`policy.csv`, or `policy.<name>.csv` for composition)
- AppProject `.spec.roles[]` — project-scoped roles; JWT tokens issuable via `argocd proj role create-token`

Minimal example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: {name: argocd-rbac-cm, namespace: argocd}
data:
  policy.default: role:readonly
  policy.csv: |
    p, role:ci, applications, sync, */*, allow
    p, role:ci, applications, get, */*, allow
    g, my-org:ci-bots, role:ci
```

## CLI quick reference

Top-level commands you'll actually use:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `argocd login <server>` | Authenticate (supports `--sso`) |
| `argocd context` | Switch between configured Argo CD servers |
| `argocd app list` / `get <name>` | Inspect Applications |
| `argocd app sync <name>` | Trigger a sync (flags: `--prune`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--revision`, `--resource`) |
| `argocd app diff <name>` | Show diff between live and desired |
| `argocd app history <name>` / `rollback <name> <id>` | Rollback to a prior sync |
| `argocd app wait <name> --health --sync` | Block until healthy/synced |
| `argocd appset list` / `get` / `create` / `delete` | Manage ApplicationSets |
| `argocd cluster add <context>` | Register a cluster |
| `argocd repo add <url>` | Register a repo |
| `argocd proj role create-token <project> <role>` | Issue a JWT for a project role |
| `argocd admin` | Direct kube access (settings validation, export/import, initial admin pw reset) |

Commands talk to the API server (needs `--server` + auth) unless `--core` is passed, which lets them hit CRs directly (no Argo CD API server needed).

## Troubleshooting

### By sync state

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| `OutOfSync` but nothing looks wrong | Controller-mutated field | Add `ignoreDifferences` (jsonPointer, jqPath, or managedFieldsManager) |
| `OutOfSync` and auto-sync not firing | `selfHeal: false` (default) or webhook missing and 3-min poll hasn't elapsed | Enable selfHeal; configure Git webhook for faster reconcile |
| `ComparisonError` | Repo unreachable, bad manifest, plugin error | Inspect `argocd-repo-server` logs; `argocd app get <name>` for error detail |
| `SyncFailed` | Hook failed, admission webhook rejected, project restriction | Check `status.operationState.message`; verify AppProject `sourceRepos`/`destinations`/resource whitelists allow the change |

### By health state

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Resource stays `Progressing` forever | No built-in health check and no Lua customization | Add a custom health check (Lua) or accept it and use sync-only gating |
| `Degraded` | Deployment can't roll out (bad image, crashloop), CronJob's last run failed, etc. | `kubectl describe` on the member; fix root cause |
| `Missing` | Resource deleted out-of-band; will be recreated on next sync if still in Git | Usually self-heals; check if pruning ran inadvertently |
| `Suspended` | Job suspended; paused CronJob; Rollouts paused step | Expected if intentional; otherwise unsuspend |

### Useful commands

```bash
# What does Argo CD think of this App?
argocd app get <name>                          # sync + health + per-resource state
argocd app diff <name>                         # live vs desired
argocd app manifests <name>                    # rendered manifests (source, live, or git)

# Force refresh from Git (ignores cache)
argocd app get <name> --refresh
argocd app get <name> --hard-refresh            # also clears repo-server cache

# Dig into a sync
argocd app sync <name> --dry-run
kubectl -n argocd logs deploy/argocd-application-controller
kubectl -n argocd logs deploy/argocd-repo-server
```

`argocd app terminate-op <name>` cancels a stuck sync operation.

## Conventions to keep in mind

1. `argoproj.io/v1alpha1` is the production API — don't wait for `v1`.
2. Applications and AppProjects live in the Argo CD namespace (default `argocd`). ApplicationSet generated Applications inherit this.
3. Every Application belongs to an AppProject — `default` if unspecified, and `default` is wide-open out of the box. Create named projects for any real workload.
4. Auto-sync requires BOTH `automated.prune` and `selfHeal` to be true for tight reconciliation; leaving them default-off is a very common "why isn't it syncing" trap.
5. Use the **annotation** resource-tracking method unless you need `label` for third-party compatibility.
6. Sync phase + wave + kind + name is the execution order — hooks use phase + wave; plain resources rely on kind ordering within wave 0.
7. Deny policies in RBAC always win, regardless of order.
8. Finalizer `resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io` on an App makes deleting the App cascade-delete its live resources; without it, the live resources are orphaned on App deletion.
9. For edge-case behavior (multi-source `$ref` resolution, progressive sync semantics, plugin generator auth), **fetch the linked upstream page** — this file is a summary, not a schema.
10. When writing Argo CD Go code or custom resource actions: table-driven tests, Lua for health/action customizations, and check the controller's log level (`--loglevel debug`) rather than guessing at sync behavior.
